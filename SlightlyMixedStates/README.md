The file `AdapFSM_mixed_V2.py` contains the functions necessary to perform the protocol simulations, including the protocol.
The code that performs the protocol simulation given the values ​​of the state dimension $d$, the mixedness $\lambda$, the ensemble size $N$, and the assembly division is located within the file "Simulation.ipynb".
The `SimulationData` folder contains the CSV files that hold the data generated during the simulations. This data corresponds to the fidelities between the original state and the estimated state at each step of the protocol.
The folders names indicate the value of $\lambda$ used in each simulation.
The file `DataAnalysis.ipynb` contains the code used to generate the graphs in each case, and the respective curve fittings.
